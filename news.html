					  <p>The world was put on hold during the start of the coronavirus pandemic and has never fully resumed, yet people now more than ever needed medical attention and advice from doctor's they know they can trust. The safest way for doctor's to consult with patients was virtually, as some patients were unable or restricted from seeing a doctor in person. However, there was no one solution to this problem where doctor's had a simple communications company to help link them and their patients at a reasonable price. </p>
