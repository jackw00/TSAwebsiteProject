TSA WEBSITE GO TIME: 
dialogue of theme :

medical on demand

due to recent global events, consumers, and the healthcare industry were forced to change their medical screening practices. 
Virtual appointments via mobile interfacing and webcam communications have been used for patients that were unable to or restricted from physicall seeing a doctor

Challenge: create a fictional medical telecommunications company and design a website. The website should serve as a guide for information about the company and their 
communication services provided. Present an overview of services as if you were a consumer. Provide the type of solutions your company creates, seels, and/or serves. 
Sections of the site may include photos, product descriptions, rendering, company history, contact, and news updates.



JACK's IDEAS:
lets call the company med tech (medical technology/communication)  
we should have a home page with pictures and overview and option
we should have an our services page with what we provide, zoom calls, apppoitment scheduling services
we should have about page  where we say who we are as students (actually us) and then how we founded our fictional company
  on this slide we should have link to the sources page where we MUST BY TSA RUBRIC cite any pictures or info used to create website
we should have a news page with what we are fictionally doing and form for signing up
