							<p>&emsp;&emsp;Michael Lazarius ios the chief executive officer of MCA. Ever since his sister died from an incorrect prescription, he knew he had to fix the medical industry. So he started a little company called MCA and now nobody can say they haven't heard of MCA. I believe nobody should be scared of technology or medical advice and with MCA's service he gurantees you won't be. Because here at MCA we want to not only look better but feel better too. </p>
